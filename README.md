Sprint Review and Retrospective Submission
This repository contains the Sprint Review and Retrospective deliverable for the SNHU Travel Application, developed using Scrum-agile methodologies. This project emphasized user-centric development, continuous integration, and adaptive planning to effectively respond to changing requirements. The detailed document can be found here.

Reflection on Essential Questions
Interpreting User Needs and Implementing into a Program
Interpreting user needs is foundational in developing effective software solutions. In this project, creating "user stories" was a critical practice that helped bridge the gap between user needs and the technical implementation. User stories framed development tasks in a way that always aligned with user benefits, which ensured that the features developed were not only technically sound but also valuable to the user. This approach helps maintain focus on the user's perspective throughout the project lifecycle.

Approach to Developing Programs
My approach to software development is iterative and feedback-driven, qualities inherent to agile methodologies. For future projects, I hope to incorporate more of these agile processes, particularly focusing on continuous delivery and integration. The use of tools like Jira for task management and GitHub alongside CircleCI for CI/CD in the SNHU Travel project exemplified how these processes could enhance productivity and adaptability.

Being a Good Team Member in Software Development
Being a good team member in software development involves more than just technical skills. It requires communication, flexibility, and a commitment to collective success. Throughout the SNHU Travel project, the role of the Scrum Master, which I held, was crucial in facilitating this environment. I focused on ensuring clear communication, resolving conflicts, and supporting each team member's contributions, which were vital in navigating mid-project changes without losing momentum.
